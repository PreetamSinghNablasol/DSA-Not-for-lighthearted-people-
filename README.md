# **DSA – Not for Lighthearted People**  
### *More Complex Than Disha’s Quantum Computing Presentation* 🤯  

Welcome to **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** – where your **brain will cry**, your **debugger will scream**, and your **coffee consumption will triple.** If you thought Quantum Computing was tough, wait till you meet **Recursion, Dynamic Programming, and Graph Theory** – the unholy trinity of pain.

## **🔥 Things That Will Break You:**  

### ⚔️ **Recursion** – The Art of Summoning Stack Overflows  
_"Why write a loop when you can confuse yourself with function calls that never end?"_  

### 🧩 **Dynamic Programming (DP)** – Memoization or Mental Breakdown?  
_"Just store the answers to subproblems!" Okay, but where? How? Why is my array out of bounds?"_  

### 🔗 **Linked Lists** – Because Arrays Were Too Mainstream  
_"Insert at head, delete at tail... oh wait, where's my pointer?"_  

### 🕵️ **Graphs & Trees** – Where BFS, DFS & Your Sanity Collide  
_"Shortest path? More like the longest debugging session of my life."_  

### 🎭 **Bit Manipulation** – The Dark Arts of Competitive Coding  
_"If you can explain XOR tricks in one sentence, you’re officially a wizard."_

## **Common Side Effects of Learning DSA:**  
✅ Questioning your life choices  
✅ Googling "Why is my algorithm O(n²) instead of O(log n)?"  
✅ Considering a career change to farming  
✅ Realizing LeetCode is your new social media
