Suffix of HORSE ? E, SE, RSE, ORSE, HORSE

what is suffix array : array which contains all the sorted suffixes of a string. SORTED IN LEXICAL order.

its an alternative to SUFFIX tree that is compressed version of a trie and also stores are suffix.

Suffix Arrays can do everyting that a suffix tree can, but, with some additional stuff like LCP array.

=) LCP array: 

LCP array is an array in which every index tracks how many characters two sorted adjacent suffixes have in common. 

eg : 

suffix array for bully :
bully 
ully  
lly   
ly    
y     

lexically sorted array for bully :

bully : 0  (we store the LCP first index value to 0)
lly   : 0
ly    : 1  (since l is common)
ully  : 0
y     : 0

LCP array [0,0,1,0,0].

algorithms for LCP array construction can be done at O(nlog(n)) and O(n).


APPLICATIONS : 

for finding all unique substrings in a given string. The naive algorithm generates all substrings and places them in a set resulting in a O(n^2) algorithm.( finding all substrings and placing them in a set).

The LCP is much more memory efficient and even space efficient. (Although there exist other OP techniques of doing this stuff.)

NOTE all sbustings of a string with n elements is : n(n+1)/2

now with some brain power, THE NUMBER OF UNIQUE SUBSTRINGS  = n(n+1)/2 - (sum of all values of the LCP array)
