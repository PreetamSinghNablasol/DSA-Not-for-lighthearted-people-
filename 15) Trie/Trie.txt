Trie is used to store strings in a space and time efficient manner,
A single node can have multiple characters too.
Every node keeps track of the end of string, ( in a trie, every node has a flag called end of string, and if that is true, means that the node is the end of string.)
NOTE : tempting it may look, dont, DONT ever create a loop in a trie, since trie is supposed to be a tree :)

Trie is a beast, check the image of trie to better understand.

Spellchecker and auto completion use trie.

NOTE : when we make a trie, A single trie node contains a Mapping of words to other words and hence a single node is capable of containing multiple words.

the ideology behind trie is that the words or suffix shared by words can be shared and hence saving time and memory in the longrun.
