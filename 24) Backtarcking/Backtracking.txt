Backtracking Algorithm: 
    In Backtracking Algorithm, the problem is solved in an incremental way i.e. it is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.
    Some common problems that can be solved through the Backtracking Algorithm are the Hamiltonian Cycle, M-Coloring Problem, N Queen Problem, Rat in Maze Problem, etc.

Easier definition is that the recursion is done in a way that based on conditions, we can come back :)

IMPORTANT NOTE: dont shy away and heistate to pass inn as many arguments as needed to be passed.
